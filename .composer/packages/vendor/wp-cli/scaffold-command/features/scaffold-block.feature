Feature: WordPress block code scaffolding

  Background:
    Given a WP install
    Given I run `wp scaffold plugin movies`
    And I run `wp plugin path movies --dir`
    And save STDOUT as {PLUGIN_DIR}
    Given I run `wp theme install p2 --activate`
    And I run `wp theme path p2 --dir`
    And save STDOUT as {THEME_DIR}
