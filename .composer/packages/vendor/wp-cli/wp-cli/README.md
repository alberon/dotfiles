WP-CLI
======

[WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) is a set of command-line tools for managing [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) installations. You can update plugins, configure multisite installs and much more, without using a web browser.

For announcements, follow [@wpcli on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wpcli) or [sign up for our email newsletter](http://wp-cli.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0615e4d18f213891fc000adfd&id=8c61d7641e). [Check out the roadmap](https://wp-cli.org/docs/roadmap/) for an overview of what's planned for upcoming releases.

## Using

WP-CLI's goal is to provide a command-line interface for any action you might want to perform in the WordPress admin. For instance, `wp plugin install --activate` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/install/)) lets you install and activate a WordPress plugin:

```bash
$ wp plugin install rest-api --activate
Installing WordPress REST API (Version 2) (2.0-beta13)
Downloading install package from https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/rest-api.2.0-beta13.zip...
Unpacking the package...
Installing the plugin...
Plugin installed successfully.
Activating 'rest-api'...
Success: Plugin 'rest-api' activated.
```

WP-CLI also includes commands for many things you can't do in the WordPress admin. For example, `wp transient delete --all` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/transient/delete/)) lets you delete one or all transients:

```bash
$ wp transient delete --all
Success: 34 transients deleted from the database.
```

For a more complete introduction to using WP-CLI, read the [Quick Start guide](https://wp-cli.org/docs/quick-start/). Or, catch up with [shell friends](https://wp-cli.org/docs/shell-friends/) to learn about helpful command line utilities.

## Installing

Downloading the Phar file is our recommended installation method. Should you need, see also our documentation on [alternative installation methods](https://wp-cli.org/docs/installing/).

Before installing WP-CLI, please make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:

- UNIX-like environment (OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin); limited support in Windows environment
- PHP 5.3.29 or later
- WordPress 3.7 or later

Once you've verified requirements, download the [wp-cli.phar](https://raw.github.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar) file using `wget` or `curl`:

```bash
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

Next, check if it is working:

```bash
$ php wp-cli.phar --info
```

To use WP-CLI from the command line by typing `wp`, make the file executable and move it to somewhere in your PATH. For example:

```bash
$ chmod +x wp-cli.phar
$ sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```

If WP-CLI was installed successfully, you should see something like this when you run `wp --info`:

```bash
$ wp --info
PHP binary:    /usr/bin/php5
PHP version:    5.5.9-1ubuntu4.14
php.ini used:   /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
WP-CLI root dir:        /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli
WP-CLI packages dir:    /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/packages/
WP-CLI global config:   /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/config.yml
WP-CLI project config:
WP-CLI version: 0.25.0
```

### Updating

You can update WP-CLI with `wp cli update` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/cli/update/)), or by repeating the installation steps.

If WP-CLI is owned by root or another system user, you'll need to run `sudo wp cli update`.

Want to live life on the edge? Run `wp cli update --nightly` to use the latest nightly build of WP-CLI. The nightly build is more or less stable enough for you to use in your development environment, and always includes the latest and greatest WP-CLI features.

### Tab completions

WP-CLI also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [wp-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/master/utils/wp-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash
```

Don't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.

If using zsh for your shell, you may need to load and start `bashcompinit` before sourcing. Put the following in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash
```

## Support

WP-CLI's maintainers and project contributors are volunteers, and have limited availability to address general support questions. The [current version of WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/docs/roadmap/) is the only officially supported version.

When looking for support, please first look for an answer in one of the following resources:

- [Common issues and their fixes](https://wp-cli.org/docs/common-issues/)
- [Documentation portal](https://wp-cli.org/docs/)
- [Open or closed issues on Github](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
- [runcommand tips](https://runcommand.io/tips/)
- [WordPress StackExchange forums](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli)

Need help with a project related to work? Professional users may want to consider [runcommand premium support](https://runcommand.io/pricing/). Alternatively, join the `#cli` channel on the [WordPress.org Slack organization](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to see if a community member might have an answer for you.

Github issues are meant for tracking enhancements and bugs of existing commands, not general support. Before submitting a bug report, please [review our best practices](https://wp-cli.org/docs/bug-reports/) to help ensure your issue is addressed in a timely manner.

Please do not ask support questions on Twitter. Twitter isn't an acceptable venue for support because: 1) it's hard to hold conversations in under 140 characters, and 2) Twitter isn't a place where someone with your same question can search for an answer in a prior conversation.

Remember, libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful, and set your expectations accordingly.

## Extending

A **command** is an atomic unit of WP-CLI functionality. `wp plugin install` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/install/)) is one command. `wp plugin activate` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/activate/)) is another.

WP-CLI supports registering any callable class, function, or closure as a command. It reads usage details from the callback's PHPdoc. `WP_CLI::add_command()` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/docs/internal-api/wp-cli-add-command/)) is used for both internal and third-party command registration.

```php
/**
 * Delete an option from the database.
 *
 * Returns an error if the option didn't exist.
 *
 * ## OPTIONS
 *
 * <key>
 * : Key for the option.
 *
 * ## EXAMPLES
 *
 *     $ wp option delete my_option
 *     Success: Deleted 'my_option' option.
 */
$delete_option_cmd = function( $args ) {
	list( $key ) = $args;

	if ( ! delete_option( $key ) ) {
		WP_CLI::error( "Could not delete '$key' option. Does it exist?" );
	} else {
		WP_CLI::success( "Deleted '$key' option." );
	}
};
WP_CLI::add_command( 'option delete', $delete_option_cmd );
```

WP-CLI comes with dozens of commands. It's easier than it looks to create a custom WP-CLI command. Read the [commands cookbook](https://wp-cli.org/docs/commands-cookbook/) to learn more. Browse the [internal API docs](https://wp-cli.org/docs/internal-api/) to discover a variety of helpful functions you can use in your custom WP-CLI command.
