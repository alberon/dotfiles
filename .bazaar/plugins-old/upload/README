Bazaar Upload
=============

Overview
--------

bzr-upload is a plugin for Bazaar which lets you upload your working tree to
a remote location using ftp/sftp.

The main target audience is web developers who keep their web pages version
controlled with bzr.

Quickstart
----------

To get started, it's as simple as running::

    bzr upload sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

This will initially upload the whole working tree, and leave a file on the
remote location indicating the last revision that was uploaded, in order to 
avoid uploading unnecessary information the next time.

If you would like to upload a specific revision, you just do:

    bzr upload -r X  sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver

bzr-upload, just as bzr does, will remember the location where you upload the 
first time, so you don't need to specify it every time.

If you need to re-upload the whole working tree for some reason, you can:

    bzr upload --full sftp://user@host/location/on/webserver


Automatically Uploading
-----------------------

bzr-upload comes with a hook that can be used to trigger an upload whenever
the tip of the branch changes, including on commit, push, uncommit etc. This
would allow you to keep the code on the target up to date automatically.

The easiest way to enable this is to run upload with the --auto option.

     bzr upload --auto

will enable the hook for this branch. If you were to do a commit in this branch
now you would see it trigger the upload automatically.

If you wish to disable this for a branch again then you can use the --no-auto
option.

     bzr upload --no-auto

will disable the feature for that branch.


Upload from Remote Location
---------------------------

It is possible to upload to a remote location from another remote location by
specifying it with the --directory option:

    bzr upload ftp://public.example.com --directory sftp://private.example.com 

This, together with --auto, can be used to upload when you push to your
central branch, rather than when you commit to your local branch.

Note that you will consume more bandwith this way than uploading from a local
branch.

Collaborating
-------------

While we don't have any platform setup, you can branch from trunk:

    bzr branch lp:bzr-upload

And change anything you'd like, and get in touch with any of the authors to 
review and add the changes.
