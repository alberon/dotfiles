This is a plugin which implements post commmit emails for bzr.

The plugin is activated by:
 - installing it
 - configuring an address to send emails to (see ``bzr help email``).

Installation
------------

The simplest way to install it for a single user is to do 
``bzr checkout https://launchpad.net/bzr-email ~/.bazaar/plugins/email``.

If you need to install it system wide, or are packing the plugin for non-source
distribution (e.g. as a .deb or .rpm) then there is a setup.py file that should
do the right thing when called with the values you use elsewhere when
installing python softare.

After installing it you can use 'bzr help email' for documentation (for bzr >=
0.16), or read the docstring at the top of __init__.py (for bzr < 0.16)

TODO
----

 - support format specifiers / email templates.
