vimdiff plugin for bzr
======================

This plugin adds 'vimdiff' and 'gvimdiff' commands to bzr, which invoke display
changes to a given file within vim.  vimdiff runs in the terminal; gvimdiff
runs in a GUI window.

To install it, put this directory inside ~/.bazaar/plugins -- ie this file
should be located at ~/.bazaar/plugins/vimdiff/README.

One nice thing about vimdiff is that it allows you to edit either file, and it
will keep the diff highlighting up to date.  (Or mostly so; if they get out of
date then run :diffupdate.) There's not much point ediiting the old version
because it's stored in a temporary file, but you can edit it and write it
somewhere else (using :saveas) if you wish.  You can even close the window
showing the old version and just look at the highlights in the new version.

The default vim diff highlighting is a bit garish; you may want to adjust it
using ":highlight DiffText gui=NONE", etc.

Future ideas
------------

 * Diff to another branch or specified previous revision.  (Should be very easy.)

 * Diff several files.  Can we show a directory listing with indication of which 
   files are changed?

 * Invoke this from inside vim.  Turn display of diffs on or off for a given file.

 * Use this to form commits: show three panes, with the old and new versions and 
   space to prepare the commit message.  Not sure how this should work for 
   commits of multiple files.
