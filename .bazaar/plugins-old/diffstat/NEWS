bzr-diffstat 0.2 2008-08-17
---------------------------

  CHANGES:

    * The diffstat command is now deprecated and will at some point be removed 
      (use ``bzr diff --stat``)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Add option to show stats on a directory basis. Use either
      ``diff --stat-dir`` or ``diffstat --dir-only`` (Mattias Eriksson)

    * Added experimental colored output mode. To enable, add color = True to
      ~/.bazaar/bazzar.conf (Russ Brown)

    * Diffstat can now be invoked using ``bzr diff --stat`` instead of the
      separate command ``bzr diffstat`` (Russ Brown)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Now works with bazaar 1.5 (Russ Brown)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added unit tests (Russ Brown)

bzr-diffstat 0.1 (THE PAST)
---------------------------

Since there has never been an officially named release of diffstat, 0.1 simply
refers to everything released by the original author, Michael Ellerman.
