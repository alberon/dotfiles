Branch Feed generator
_____________________

This plugin creates a branch.atom file after every commit, push and pull. The
amount of detail contained in the branch.atom file currently is always 20
items, but it is planned to be made configurable.

There is a bugtracker, specification tracker etc at
https://launchpad.net/bzr-branchfeed/.
